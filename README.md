# Proof Assistants PoC

Proof of Concept to help choosing a proof assistant to formalize ReAna-SPL.

The main theorem proved in Coq is in ReliabilityModels/Annotative.v
(definitions and lemmas to support _Annotative Probabilistic Models_).

For PVS, it is a TCC (type-correctness condition) in annotative_reliability_models.pvs.
